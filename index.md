Hello, I am a computer science major and I am planning to graduate in 2028

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2-
*Lab 2 was my first favorite lab because during this lab I got to meet Keira. At first I did not know how to navigate and code very well. But Keira taught me a lot and held my hand through the process. This is also where I learned mostly about organization and formatting in order for the system to accept the text. Overall, it was a great second week where we started to do real programming and coding. 

Lab 6- Part1
*Lab 6 is another one of my favorite labs. I got to work with one of my friends that Iâ€™ve known for a long time. The best part of the project was the sandwich.cc. THis is because we were able to code a system to recognize whether something was a sandwich or not. The project was very humorous but at the same time very interesting because there were many if statements.

Lab 9 - 
*This Lab is another one of my favorite because not only did I get to work with one of my friends, but I also worked with another friend. We had to pur our heads together to find the secret code and use it to code the program. This project was fun because it reminded me a lot of a video game when you find a hidden easter egg.
